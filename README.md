# Todo App
My first react app. The Todo App allows a user to create a checklist of todos, and check off individual todos to indicate if it is done or not.
Tried to learn react because I would like to stay current on industry trends.
Also, learned how to deploy my first react-app through github-pages, which was oddly difficult despite following the documentation.
